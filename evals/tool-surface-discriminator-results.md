# Tool Surface Discriminator, Thin Screen

Date: 2026-07-19

This is a provisional architecture screen, not the final compatibility evaluation.

## Valid lane

`gpt-5.6-sol` completed all six frozen jobs against all three candidate surfaces.

| Candidate | Passed | Advertised tools | Advertised tokens | Average turns | Average dynamic result tokens |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `registry-3` | 6/6 | 3 | 345 | 3.00 | 964 |
| `hybrid-10` | 6/6 | 10 | 2,034 | 2.67 | 489 |
| `domains-8` | 6/6 | 8 | 1,378 | 2.50 | 2,248 |

The token figures are character-based estimates using four characters per token. Dynamic result cost includes discovery and schema results returned during tool use.

## Blocked lane

`claude-sonnet-5` was not evaluated. The local OpenAI-compatible proxy rejected all requests before model execution because its Claude OAuth token had expired. Direct Claude CLI access remained healthy. These cells are infrastructure-blocked, not candidate failures.

The runner accepts `EVAL_MODELS`, so the blocked lane can be resumed without repeating the valid lane:

```sh
EVAL_MODELS=claude-sonnet-5 LOG_LEVEL=error node evals/run-tool-surface-discriminator.mjs
```

## Historical provisional cut

This section records the July 19 first-screen decision. It was superseded by the actual Claude finalist screen and the two-tool control documented below.

At this checkpoint, advance `registry-3` and `hybrid-10`.

Drop `domains-8`. It passed the jobs, but returned the most runtime schema material, induced redundant discovery in the cross-domain job, and depends on clients handling schema discovery through an ordinary tool call. Its small turn-count advantage did not offset those costs.

`registry-3` was the lead at this checkpoint. Its advertised surface was about 1,689 tokens smaller than `hybrid-10`, and its average advertised-plus-dynamic cost in this screen was about 1,309 tokens versus 2,523. `hybrid-10` remained a finalist because direct common operations could avoid discovery and completed the parameter-dense search in one turn.

## Scope caveat

The harness stops once the required capability and key arguments have been reached. It measures tool selection, argument construction, chaining, and safe refusal. It does not score prose answer quality. One trial per cell is directional evidence only.

## Final two-tool control

Date: 2026-07-21

A `registry-2` control merged search and schema inspection. Its `search_tools` result included complete input schemas, followed by the same generic `call_tool` execution path used by `registry-3`. The same six frozen jobs ran through the actual Claude stdio MCP client.

| Candidate | Search result cap | Passed | Advertised tools | Advertised tokens | Average turns | Average dynamic result tokens | Advertised plus dynamic |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `registry-2` | 3 full schemas | 5/6 | 2 | 238 | 5.50 | 3,005 | 3,243 |
| `registry-2` | 5 full schemas | 6/6 | 2 | 238 | 3.17 | 2,089 | 2,327 |
| `registry-3` preserved Claude baseline | 8 summaries, selected schemas loaded separately | 6/6 | 3 | 345 | not preserved | 875 | 1,220 |

The three-result control missed `getConversation`, which ranked fourth or fifth for ordinary conversation wording. The five-result control corrected that retrieval-recall problem and passed all six jobs. It also returned enough schema material to use about 91 percent more advertised-plus-dynamic context than the preserved `registry-3` Claude baseline.

The control supports retaining `registry-3`. The separate schema-inspection step costs one additional advertised tool and about 107 advertised tokens, but avoids returning several unselected schemas on every search. This is still a directional six-job screen, not release certification.
